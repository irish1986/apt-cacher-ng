## Hiearchy

I had been a contributor and maintaineer of [sameersbn/apt-cacher-ng](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-apt-cacher-ng) for a while but the project seems not to received the right level of commitment for it owner.  Being a secondary maintainer means I had limited access to a few topics that irritated me.  Thanks for your help and support on this project, I am forking (and restarting) this project on my own.

It is also a nice exercice rebuilding something from scratch.
